# Flight Controller for Small UAVs

This is an experiment to make a flight controller, using the Atmel ATMega 328P microcontroller, that is capable of producing 4 PWM signals for conventional ESCs and reading 1 PPM signal from a radio controller. The flight controller will be made for three types of vehicle: quadcopter, tricopter, and bicopter; all of which required 4 PWM outputs.
